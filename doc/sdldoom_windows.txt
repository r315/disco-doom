Right, since I'm so nice (and, more importantly avoiding work  ), I got it to work.

I did it at the command line, although you should be able to adapt it to the IDE. This is with Dev-C++ 4, using the default install that you get when you first install Dev-C++. (gcc version 2.95.2. Use gcc -v to find out the version, but it shouldn't be important).

1) Tried

gcc *.c -c -Ic:\dev-c++\include\SDL

Works except for IPPORT_USERRESERVED in i_net.c

I just copied the three lines from the BEOS section (it's in the code you posted) into the WIN32 section. I don't know if that is correct for the platform, but at least it compiles.

The WIN32 section thus looks like:

#ifdef __WIN32__
#define Win32_Winsock
#include <windows.h>
#ifndef IPPORT_USERRESERVED
#define IPPORT_USERRESERVED 5000
#endif
#else


You get 2 warnings about incorrect parameters to sendto & recvfrom. I don't think thats important, although I didn't check.

2) Now the linking.

First tried

gcc *.c -Ic:\dev-c++\include\SDL -mwindows -lsdlmain -lsdl -lwsock32

That worked except for WinMain@16

After a bit of searching, found that

gcc *.c -Ic:\dev-c++\include\SDL -mwindows -lmingw32 -lsdlmain -lsdl -lwsock32

builds the executable. It runs but I don't have the data files to try it out with.

Do I get my 50 quid now?  

EDIT: Oh yeah, you'll need to have SDL for mingw32 too, but I presume you've got that and dev-c++ correctly installed.
